### Dataset Description

Dataset Description
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared 
the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 44,000 scholarly articles, including over 
29,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided 
to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to 
generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for 
these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical 
research community to keep up.
